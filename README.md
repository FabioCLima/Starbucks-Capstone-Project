# Starbucks-Capstone-Project
Understand how Starbucks customers use the app and how well app's offers works.
Thank you for providing the Jupyter notebook. I'll review its contents and then produce a summary document and a README based on the project's details. 

Let's start by examining the contents of the notebook.

Based on the initial review of the notebook's content, it seems the notebook follows the CRISP-DM methodology and delves into understanding Starbucks offers and user interactions with them.

To create a concise summary and a README, I'll structure the document as follows:

---

### README:

**Starbucks Capstone Challenge**
- **Objective**: Understand how Starbucks customers use the app and how well the app's offers work.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
- **Data**: Utilizes data from three files: 
  - `portfolio.json` - Contains offer IDs and metadata about each offer.
  - `profile.json` - Contains demographic data for each customer.
  - `transcript.json` - Contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
- **Summary of Findings**: [This will include a high-level summary of the main results, which we'll extract after a more detailed review of the notebook].
- **Setup and Installation**: Instructions for setting up the environment and reproducing results.

### Project Document:

**1. Introduction**
- A brief overview of the project, its objectives, and the importance of understanding customer interactions with Starbucks offers.

**2. Data Understanding**
- Details about the three datasets used in the project and initial observations.

**3. Data Preparation**
- Steps taken to clean and preprocess the data for modeling. This will include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Key insights derived from the data through visualization and statistical analysis. 

**5. Modeling**
- Description of the modeling techniques used, including model selection, training, and evaluation metrics.

**6. Results & Discussion**
- Discussion of the model results, performance metrics, and key takeaways.

**7. Conclusion & Recommendations**
- Final thoughts on the project findings and any recommendations or next steps based on the analysis.

I'll now delve deeper into the notebook to extract more specific details and results for the above sections. Let's continue reviewing the notebook's content.

From the extracted content and earlier sections, it seems that the notebook follows a structured approach to the problem, starting with understanding the business context, exploring the data, and then moving into modeling.

The project begins with a thorough understanding of the data using visualizations, discussing aspects like the distribution of age, income, gender, and the types of offers users interact with.

Let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Extract key findings, insights, and results from the notebook.
2. Draft the project document and README based on the provided structure and extracted content.

Now, I'll continue reviewing the notebook's content to extract the modeling results and any other key findings that will help in the documentation process.

Based on the extracted content from the notebook, here's an overview of the key elements:

1. **Modeling**:
    - The objective of the modeling phase is to predict how much a user will spend based on demographics and offer type.
    - The target variable is `amount`, representing the amount of money a customer spends.
    - The features include demographics (`age`, `gender`, `income`) and `offer_type`.

2. **Exploration and Visualization**:
    - Descriptive statistics and visualizations were used to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
    - Key insights:
        - Distribution of age suggests potential outliers or placeholder data.
        - Income distribution is bimodal.
        - Middle-aged customers (around 40-60 years) seem to have a higher total expense.
        - Customers with higher incomes tend to spend more in total.
        - Customers with higher incomes might also make more transactions.

3. **Data Preparation**:
    - Identified missing values and ensured data consistency.
    - The target variable is `amount`, and the rest of the columns are used as features. 
    - Cleaning, handling missing values, and potentially scaling or normalizing the numerical features were mentioned as next steps.

Given this overview, I'll begin drafting the summary document and README based on the proposed structure.

### Draft of the Project Document:

**Introduction**:
The Starbucks Capstone Challenge is centered around understanding how Starbucks customers use the app and the effectiveness of the app's offers. The goal is to predict the amount a user will spend based on demographics and offer type.

**Data Understanding**:
Three datasets were used in the project:
- `portfolio` - Provides details about different offers, including type, duration, and channels used.
- `profile` - Offers demographic information about users, such as age, gender, and income.
- `transcript` - Captures the interactions of users with offers and transactions.

Through preliminary exploration, key findings include:
- Most users are aged between 40 and 70.
- Income distribution shows multiple peaks, especially around 50k-75k.
- The gender distribution shows more males than females.

**Modeling**:
The modeling phase was aimed at understanding the influence of demographic factors and offer types on the amount a user spends. The target variable was the `amount` spent, while features included demographics and offer types.

### Draft of the README:

**Starbucks Capstone Challenge**:
- **Objective**: Predict how much a user will spend based on demographics and offer type.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Data**: Three datasets (`portfolio`, `profile`, `transcript`) providing offer details, user demographics, and interactions.
- **Setup and Installation**: [This can include steps to set up the environment, dependencies, and how to run the code.]

This is a high-level draft based on the content extracted. Before finalizing, I'll continue reviewing the notebook to ensure all key insights, methodologies, and results are captured. Shall I proceed?
